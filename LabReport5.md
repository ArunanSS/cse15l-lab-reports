Student(Nirrbhay Raghavan): Hi am having some issues with my code. I ran the practice code from cse 11 and found a terminal output that needed me to run the bash file.
I see an error in the file code. I don't know where to go from here, what should be the designated output and how should I get there. Can you help me find the error and also debug it.

I included photos below with my code and error message that comes with it

TA(Vikas Muruli): Hello! Don't stress buddy I'll help you out. Looking at the code that you have writen and the terminal I see an issue with the terminal file.
Now what I don't want to give it to you,but hears a hint to think about. We talked about different errors in class, one specific ArrayIndexOutofBounds. 
Now that you see the type of error, look in the code to check the lines where you get the error. To edit the file directly I want you to go to the professor's github and check
week 7 where we went over VIM. Now can you try that out for me then send it to me again. 

Student: Wow I can't believe I made such a simple error without registering that. You're right I see the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds error, and went on w3school to understand it better. 
I messed up on a part that I am usually very confident in, the for loop.
