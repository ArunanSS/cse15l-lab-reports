- The methods in my code that are called is Handler, HandleRequest, and chatServer
- The relevant arguements for the method of for the handle request would be the url which is passed, and for the main method the port of local host, message typed and the user typing it
- There is one value that would chage in the code and the would be the messageHistory list because we are saving multiple changes in the URL that local host is using, the list increases in size.

- Well similar to the actual code the methods that are being ussed is Handler, HandleRequest, and chatServer
- Relevant argument for the handleRest is the url that is being passed. For the main method its the port of the local host that we are using. And as for messages, it is what we as the user type and paste
- It is shown that the value that is changed in the server is that multiple changes that we make to the url is updated there. First it is saved then the next line is printed.

## Part 3
There is a good amount of new things that I learned over the week 2 and week 3 labs. I think what interested me most was how we learned about webservers and all the commands that went along with it. Building and running servers, was very cool especially when we ran ours on peers remote computer. The task of building the simple model of the search engine taught me a lot as well.
